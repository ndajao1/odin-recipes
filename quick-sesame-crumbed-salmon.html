    <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
    <ol>
        <li>oil the kettle.Half-fill a medium saucepan with boiling water. Add jasmine rice and a pinch of salt and cook, uncovered, 
            over a high heat until tender, 12-14 minutes. Drain, rinse with warm water and return to saucepan. Stir through 
            vegetable stock powder.</li>
        <li>While rice is cooking, finely grate ginger. Thinly slice carrot into half-moons. Trim green beans and slice into thirds. 
            Roughly chop baby spinach leaves.In a small bowl, combine Japanese dressing and mayonnaise. Set aside.
            In a shallow bowl, add mixed sesame seeds. Pat salmon dry with paper towel, drizzle with olive oil, then season with salt and pepper.
            Press salmon, skin-side down, into sesame seeds to coat.</li>
        <li>In a large frying pan, heat a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat. When oil is hot, cook salmon, skin-side down first, 
            until just cooked through, 2-4 minutes each side (depending on thickness). Transfer to a plate to rest.
            Wipe out the frying pan and return to a medium-high heat. Cook carrot, green beans and ginger with a dash of water, stirring, until 
            just tender, 4-5 minutes.Add baby spinach, soy sauce and sesame oil (if using) and cook until spinach is wilted, 1-2 minutes.</li>
