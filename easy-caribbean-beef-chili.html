    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
    <ul>
        <li>4 potato</li>
        <li>1 can corn</li>
        <li>1 packet beef mince</li>
        <li>2 packet tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 packet mango mayonnaise</li>
        <li>2 satchet mild Caribbean jerk seasoning</li>
        <li>2 packet garlic paste</li>
        <li>1 bag slaw mix</li>
        <li>1 bag coriander</li>
        <li>1 packet shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 drizzle white wine vinegar</li>
    </ul>

    <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
    <ol>
        <li> Preheat oven to 200°C/180°C fan-forced. Cut each potato in half. Place cut-side down on a lined oven tray.
             Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt. Roast until crisp and tender, 40-45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain sweetcorn. Heat a large frying pan over a high heat. Cook corn kernels until lightly browned, 4-5 minutes. 
            Set aside in a medium bowl. When potatoes have 10 minutes remaining, return frying pan to a high heat with a drizzle of olive oil. 
            Cook beef mince, breaking up with a spoon, until just browned, 3-4 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. 
            Add garlic paste, tomato paste and mild Caribbean jerk seasoning. Cook until fragrant, 1 minute. 
            Add the water and simmer until thickened slightly, 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <p>TIP: Cover the pan with a lid if the kernels are "popping" out.</p>
        <li>While chilli is simmering, add slaw mix, mango mayonnaise and a drizzle of white wine vinegar to bowl with the corn.
            Toss to combine. Season to taste.</li>
        <li>Divide jacket potatoes between plates. Spoon over Caribbean beef chilli and sprinkle with shredded Cheddar cheese.
            Serve with corn slaw. Tear over the coriander to serve.</li>
    </ol>
