    <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
    <p>Impart a smoky, salty depth of flavour to your risotto by adding chorizo. Balance out the
    richness with roasted cherry tomatoes, which offer sweetness, juiciness, acidity and pretty pop of colour.</p>

    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 chorizo</li>
        <li>2 brown onion</li>
        <li>4 garlic clove</li>
        <li>1 packet aborio rice</li>
        <li>2 packs cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>shaved Parmesean cheese</li>
        <li>thyme</li>
        <li>chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 bag baby spinach leaves</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>40g butter</li>
    </ul>

    <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 220°C/200°C fan-forced. Roughly chop the mild chorizo. 
            Finely chop the brown onion and garlic. Pick the thyme leaves.</li>
        <li>In a large frying pan, heat a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat. 
            Cook the chorizo, stirring, until golden and crisp, 3-4 minutes. Add the 
            onion and cook, stirring, until softened, 4 minutes. Add the garlic and thyme
             and cook until fragrant, 1 minute. Stir in the arborio rice until well combined.</li>
        <li>To the risotto, add the water and chicken stock pot. Stir well, then bring to the boil. 
            Transfer the risotto to a baking dish. Cover tightly with foil. Bake until the 
            liquid is absorbed and the rice is 'al dente', 24-28 minutes.</li>
            
            <p>TIP: 'Al dente' rice is cooked through but still slightly firm in the centre.</p>
        <li>While the risotto is baking, halve the cherry tomatoes. Place on a lined oven tray. 
            Drizzle with olive oil, season with salt and pepper and toss to coat. 
            Roast until blistered, 15-20 minutes.</li>
        <li>When the risotto is done, stir through a splash of water to loosen, if needed. 
            Stir in the shaved Parmesan cheese, the butter and baby spinach leaves. 
            Gently fold in the roasted cherry tomatoes. Season to taste.</li>
        <li>Divide the baked chorizo and spinach risotto between bowls to serve.</li>
    </ol>
